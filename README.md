## About this project
This project was made as my First Year DV100 Term 3 Submission project at The Open Window institute.
This website was designed to simulate a Cruise Ships website, complete with a page of available trip options.

Below is a set of images of the home page design

## Demonstration Video
Below is a video showcasing the functionality of the website
Unfortunately its too large to upload normally so I have to upload a zip

## Getting started
To get started with this project at the very least you'd need a github account, which presumably you have if you are reading this. Alongside github desktop and an IDE of your choice, I used VS Code for this project, and thats all it would take to get a local copy of this project onto your machine. 


## Built With
As already mentioned, I used github and visual studio code for this project. The languages used in this were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Alongside JQuery, more JQuery than vanilla javascript. I also used the open weather api which can be found using this link: https://openweathermap.org/api


## Contributing
To add to this file all you would need to do is make a pull request, download the code to your machine. Then you can make the changes you wish. To merge the changes you've made onto the same branch as the original you'd need to make a push request. From that point on I can approve any changes. 


## Authors
The only author would be me, Kurt Schwimmbacher.


## License 
This project is open to anyone who would like access to it. 
Anything you get out of this I'd appreciate a nod in my direction but it's not required in any way.
